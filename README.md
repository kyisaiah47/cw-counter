# Proof of Work Smart Contract

A **CosmWasm smart contract** written in Rust for trustless, on-chain freelance jobs.  
Clients can post jobs, workers can submit proofs, and clients can accept/reject work‚Äîall managed transparently on the blockchain.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Post Jobs:** Anyone can create a new job with a description.
- **Submit Proof:** Workers submit on-chain proof of completion for specific jobs.
- **Client Acceptance:** Only the original client can accept submitted proof and mark jobs as completed.
- **Full Query Support:** List all jobs or fetch individual job details by ID.
- **Ownership:** Contract owner saved at initialization for admin operations.

```bash
cargo wasm
```

### Deploy

Upload the compiled WASM to your preferred CosmWasm-compatible blockchain using your favorite CLI or dApp.

### Execute

  `ExecuteMsg::PostJob { description }`
- **Submit Proof:**  
  `ExecuteMsg::SubmitProof { job_id, proof }`
- **Accept Proof:**  
  `ExecuteMsg::AcceptProof { job_id }`

### Query

- **Get Job Details:**

- **List All Jobs:**  
  `QueryMsg::ListJobs {}`

## üìù Example

```json
// Post a new job
{
  "post_job": {
    "description": "Design a landing page for our new product."
  }
}

// Submit proof of work
{
  "submit_proof": {
    "job_id": 1,
    "proof": "https://link.to/my/proof.png"
  }
}

// Accept the proof (client only)
{
  "accept_proof": {
    "job_id": 1
  }
}

// Query a job
{
  "get_job": {
    "job_id": 1
  }
}
```
